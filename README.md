# 🧩 Piece by Piece

A first-person exploration and puzzle game where you play a **cleaner with a vacuum** — but not just any vacuum. Your task is to **reassemble broken statues** scattered across a mysterious space by identifying and inserting the correct missing objects.

Everything in the environment can be **sucked** and **emitted**, making every object a potential piece of the puzzle.
